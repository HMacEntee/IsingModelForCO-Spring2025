\begin{abstract}
The integration of quantum computing in finance holds significant promise in showcasing the power of quantum supremacy. By utilizing the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we are able to perform the MaxCut operation on a connected graph of stocks to perform portfolio optimization. In QAOA, a quantum-classical loop consisting of a parameterized quantum circuit and classical optimizer solves a combinatorial problem. This poster shows how we were able to map stock market information to a graph that can undergo the operation of QAOA. Our implementation focuses on using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to evaluate stocks, and aims to separate the portfolio to diversify the portfolio, minimizing risk and maximizing return.

We demonstrate the functionality of our implementation on a weighted 5-complete graph. This graph considers 5 stocks and minimizes the correlation between the two to create a diverse portfolio. We achieved a fidelity of 81\% using 8 repetitions on the simulated environment.

\section{Introduction}
The Ising model is a mathematical model of a ferromagnetic material under the presence of a magnetic field, which allows for the analysis of the thermodynamics of a system of ferromagnetic particles\cite{b1}. When applied with the spin glass magnetic state, the Ising spin-glass model can be utilized to analyze the thermodynamics of unordered or chaotic systems. Particularly, the spin-glass Ising model aligns each ferromagnetic particle in a lattice with a random spin-interactions depicted as: $\sigma \in \{-1, +1\}$. For the purpose of this document, we will consider the spin-glass Ising model to compute NP-Hard problems. %That is, the spins are randomly distributed between $\pm1$.

Formally, the $N$-spin Ising problem aims to find the configuration of spins that minimizes the energy Hamiltonian, 
\begin{equation}
H = -\sum_{i,j<N}J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j - \sum_ih_i\sigma_i
\end{equation}
where $J_{ij}$ represents the coupling coefficient, negligible for non-neighboring spins, and $h_i$ represents the magnetic field acting on spin $i$. This document will explore the solving of the NP-Hard problem MaxCut using the Ising spin glass model. As such, the energy of MaxCut can be modeled by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
Cut(s) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{(i,j)\in E}(1-\sigma_i\sigma_j)
\end{equation}
To map this to the Hamiltonian for Ising spin glass and maintain the objective of the problem, we aim to solve for the ground state of $H(s) = -Cut(s)$. In other words, we have the following equation representing the Hamiltonian we will strive to minimize:
\begin{equation}
H(s) = \sum_{(i,j)\in E}\sigma_i\sigma_j
\end{equation}
Due to the difficulty of finding the minimum Hamiltonian of a chaotic systems, the Ising spin glass model is a NP-Hard problem for classical computers. Naturally, we are able to correlate this property to all NP-Hard problems, and can justifiably state that Ising spin glasses can be polynomially mapped to all other NP-Hard problems\cite{b2}.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}\label{FAT}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.
